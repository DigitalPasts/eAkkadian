    "# L1.7: The Locative-Adverbiative\n",
    "The adverbial *-um* as the adverbial *-iš* represents an old case form, which in Old Akkadian or Old Assyrian was still in use but in the Old Babylonian it is not productive anymore.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The ending *-um* has a locative function, thus it corresponds to the genitive preceded by the preposition *ana* or *ina*.\n",
    "- It can be used independently without a preposition:\n",
    "  ```{admonition} Example\n",
    "  *ištēn manaʾum* \"in/for one mina\".\n",
    "  ``` \n",
    "- Or with the preposition *ina* or *ana*\n",
    "  ```{admonition} Example\n",
    "  *ina bītum* \"In the house\".\n",
    "  ``` \n",
    "- When it is used with another noun, the second is in genitive:\n",
    "  ```{admonition} Example\n",
    "  - *qerbum Babili* \"In the middle of Babylon\".\n",
    "  - *ina libbu mātim* \"inside the land\". In this case *libbu* without the final *-m*.\n",
    "  ``` \n",
    "- It can also be used with suffixes. In this case the *-m* assimilates before the suffix.\n",
    "- When it is used with another noun the second is in genitive:\n",
    "  ```{admonition} Example\n",
    "  - *šaptukki* \"on your lip\" (= *ina šaptīki*).\n",
    "  - *qerbuššu* \"in its midst\" (= *ina qerbīšu*).\n",
    "  - *šepūʾa \"at my foot\".\n",
    "\n",
    "- Sometimes it is preceded by the morpheme *-ān*:\n",
    "  ```{admonition} Example\n",
    "  - *šaplānum* \"underneath\" (from *šaplum* \"underside\").\n",
    "  - *elēnum* \"above, beyond\" (from *ēlûm* \"uper\").\n",
    "  ``` \n",
    "- The use of the locative-adverbial ending is restricted to a few frozen adverbial forms, such as *libbum*."
