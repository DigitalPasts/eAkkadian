    "Die native designation of the language was *akkadû* i.e. *akkadītu* “Akkadian”. It is also used to refer to its dialect like \"Babylonian\" or \"Assyrian\".

It was spoken in the south of Mesopotamia, but attestations of its use are be found in northern Mesopotamia, Elam, Syria, Israel, etc. It is the best attested dialect regarding the number of texts. The Old Babylonian stage is normally used as reference language in introductory textbooks (the same in this online coursebook) and comparative semitic studies.\n",
