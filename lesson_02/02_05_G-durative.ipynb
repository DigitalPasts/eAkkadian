    "# L2.5: The G Durative\n",
    "The durative denotes an action that takes place over a period of time or an action that has not taken place. It can thus be translated according to the context as simple future, present tense, durative/circumstancial, habitual and modal. In other textbooks the durative is called **Present** or **Present-Furture** \n",
