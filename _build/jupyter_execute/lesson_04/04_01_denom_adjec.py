# # L3.5: Denominative Adjectives
# To form the denominative adjectives  the endin ***-ī*** is added to the base of many nouns, including proper nouns, to denote a relation of belonging:
# 
# ```{admonition} Example
# - *mahru* "front, front side" → *mahrī* + *um* = *mahrûm* "former, earlier, previous, first"
# - *šaplu* "underside, bottom" → *šaplī* + *um* = *šaplûm "lower"
# ```
# 
# ## Gentilic Adjectives
# When the ending of the denominative adjective ***-ī*** is added to a place name they are referred as gentilic adjectives
# 
# ```{admonition} Example
# - *Akkade* "Akkad" → *Akkadī* + *um* = *Akkadûm* "Akkadian"
# ```
# 
# ## Declination of the Denominative Adjectives

# |------- | -----     | -----------       | ---------    |
