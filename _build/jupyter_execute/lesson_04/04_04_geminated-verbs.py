# # L4.2. Geminated Verbs
# These verbs have a reduplicated second radical, geminated, and become a triconsonantical root. The Akkadian language has absorved these verbs into the triconsoantical system, so that they behave like strong verbs. 
# 
# ```{admonition} Good-to-Know 游뱁
# :class: tip 
# The term *geminated* comes from the latin *geminatio* which means doubling. Remeber the name of the constellation *gemini* "twins". These verbs are also known as *mediae geminatae*. 
# ```
# However it is relevant to note that the geminated fientic verbs build a semantic class. They have a durative connotation, they describe actions and processes that consist on a series small similar actions or processes:
# 
# ```{admonition} example 
# - *코ak캐ku* "pile up"
# - *코ak캐ku* "to line up"
# - *zan캐nu* "rain" 
# ```
