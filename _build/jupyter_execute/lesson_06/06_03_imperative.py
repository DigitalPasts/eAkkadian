# # L6.1: Imperative and Cohortative
# The imperative is the form for commands. 
# 
# - It occurs only in the second person. 
# - The form of the imperative is essentially the preterite without a prefix.
# - It expresses a possitive comand. It can not be negated. For the negated command see the prohibitive. 
# - Thus the theme vowel is always that of the preterite:
# 
# ```{admonition} Example
# - Preterite: *iprus* "he divided"
# - Imperative: *purus* "divide!"
# ```
# 
# - The ending for the feminine singular is *-ī*.
# - The ending for the plural communis *-ā*.
# - When endings are added, the unstressed vowel of the second syllable is elided;
# 
# ```{admonition} Example
# - 2. masc. sing.: *purus* "divide!"
# - 2. fem. sing.: *pursī* "divide!"
# - pl. com.: *pursā* "divide!"
# ```
# 
# - The only exception to this rule are the following five verbs of the *a*-class verbs:
# 
# ```{admonition} Exceptions
# - *lamādum* "to learn" → *limad*
# - *palāhum* "to fear, worship" → *pilah*
# - *pašāhum* "to refresh oneself" → *pisah*
# - *rakābum* "to ride, mount* → *rikab*
# - *takālum* "to trust" → *tikal*
# ```
# 
# ## Conjugation of the Imperative
# |         | 2ms      | 2fs      | pl.com. |
# | -----   | -------  | -------- | ------- |
# | G *a-u* | *purus*  | *pursī*  | *pursā* | 
# | G *i*   | *širiq*  | *širqī*  | *širqā* |
# | G *a*   | *ṣabat*  | *ṣabtī*  | *ṣabtā*
# | G *u*   | *muqut*  | *muqtī*  | *muqtā*
# 
# ## The Cohortative 
# This is the form for commands in the 1. plural:
# 
# - It is built with the particle *i* and the preterite:
# 
# ```{admonition} Example
# *i niprus* "We want to divide / Let's divide"
# ```
