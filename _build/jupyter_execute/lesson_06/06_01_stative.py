# # L6.1: Stative
# It is still a matter of discussion if the stative is a verbal or a nominal form. It seems to have developped from a nominal sentence but at the same time it possesses personal endings like a verb. Thus in this coursebook it will be treated as a category on its own between verbs and nouns. The stative is used to describe states in constrast to the tenses, that reproduce dynamic actions, events, processes, etc.
