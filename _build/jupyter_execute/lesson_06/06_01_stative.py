# # L6.1: Stative
# It is still a matter of discussion if the stative is a verbal or a nominal form. It seems to have developped from a nominal sentence but at the same time it possesses personal endings and can have objects like a verb. Thus in this coursebook it will be treated as a category on its own between verbs and nouns. 
# 
# - The stative is used to describe timeless states in constrast to the tenses, that reproduce dynamic actions, events, processes, etc.
# 
# ```{admonition} Example
# Stative: *ṭāb* "it is good"
# Preterite: *iṭīb* "he became good"
# ```
