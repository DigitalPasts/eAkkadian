# # L2.6: The G Perfect
# The perfect is a tense that often corresponds roughly to the English present perfect. It designates actions that have just been completed or the effects of which continue into the present. The perfect is formed with infixed *-ta-*.
# 
# ```{important}
# Pattern: Prefix + ***R₁taR₂vR₃*** (+ suffix)
# ```
# ## Personal Affixes
# The personal affixes for the perfect are the same as the those of the G preterite. 😌

# Note that the short vowel ***a*** between **R₂** and **R₃** is not present in those forms with a long vowel after the short one. That is because of the [**vowel syncope**](vowel-sync).
