# # L2.2: Verbal System
# This is an introduction to verbal system. The intention is to offer an overview of all possible forms and derivations of the verb. 
# 
# ```{admonition} Don't panic! üò® 
# You don't need to memorize all forms now ü§Ø. We will learn them step by step in the following lessons üòå.
# ```
# 
# ## Non-Finite forms
# Non-finite forms are nominal forms and as such declinable. There are three of them:
# 
# - Infinitive
# - Participle
# - Verbal Adjective
# 
# | Non-Finite Form | Pattern       | Akkadian Word  | Translation    | Hebrew  |
# | --------------- | ----------- | ------------ | ------------ | ------ |  
# | Infinitve       | *parƒÅsum*     | *mahƒÅ·π£um*      | to strike      | 
# | Participle      | *pƒÅrisum*     | *≈°ƒÅriqum*      | the one that steal |
# | Verbal Adjective | *parsum*     | *mar·π£um*       | sick           | 
# 
# ## Finite Forms
# This forms are inflected by person, gender, number, [indicative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammatical_mood) tenses and [injunctive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammatical_mood) forms:
# 
# | Finite Form     | Pattern       | Translation    | Hebrew         | 
# | --------------- | ----------- | ------------- | ------------- |  
# | Durative        | *iparras*     | he decides     |                | 
# | Preterite       | *iprus*       | he decided     |                |
# | Perfect         | *iptaras*     | he has decided |                 | 
# | Imperative      | *purus*       | decide!        |                | 
# | Precative       | *liprus*      | may he decide  |                |
# | Vetitive        | *ayy-iprus*   | may you not decide |             | 
# 
# ## Stative
# It is still a matter of dicussion if the stativ is a nominal or a finite form. Nevertheless there is agreement that it arose from a nominal sentence. It describes a state in constrast to the tenses that describe processes, actions, results, etc.
# 
# | Pattern       | Translation    | Hebrew         | 
# | ----------- | ------------ | ------------- |  
# | paris         | *damiq*        | He is good     |
# |               | *mari·π£*        | He is sick    |  
# |               | *≈°akin*        | It is placed   |
# |               | *≈°almin*       | He is well
# 
# ```{admonition} Good-to-know ü§ì
# :class: tip
# The usage of the stative makes Akkadian the most archaic Semitic language. It separates the west Semitic family form the east family. The Hebrew verb system is partly developped from the stative. 
# ```
# 
# ## Stems
# All verbs can be derived according to stems. This is a modification of the root by length of the second radical, prefixes, infixes, etc, which can also be combined with each other. Each of these stems are conventionally referred by letters that represent them:
# 
# | Stem Designation  | Form              | Explanation                   | 
# | ----------------  | --------------- | ---------------------------- | 
# | *G*               | No changes        | Base meaning. Citation form   | 
# | *D*               | Length of *R‚ÇÇ*    | Causative, pluralic           | 
# | *≈†*               | Prefix *≈°(a)/≈°u*  | Causative                     | 
# | *N*               | Pr√§fix *n(a)*     | Passive                       | 
# | *Gt/Dt/≈†t*        | Infix *t(a)* together with the element of the main stem | Iterative                   | 
# | *Gtn*             | Infix *tan* in durative in the other tenses *ta* and length of R‚ÇÇ | pluralic
# | *Dtn*/*≈†tn*/*Ntn* | Infix *tan* in durative in the other tenses *ta*| pluralic
# | *≈†D*           | Prefix ≈° and length of R‚ÇÇ | Like *D* or *≈†* | 
# | *Dtr*          | Reduplikations and length of R‚ÇÇ | Like Dt |
# | *Nt*           | Prefix *n* + Infix *ta* | Likw Gt | 
# 
# 
# Each one of these stem has a different function and are inflected for the same finite and non-finite forms as well as stative.  
# 
# ```{note}
# Each one of these stem has its own inflected for the finite and non-finite forms as well as stative.

# ## Sematic Category
# Most verbs may be assigned to one of the three semantic categories:
# 
# ### Active-Transitive Verbs
# Verbs that take a direct object.
#   
# | G-stem Infinitive | Translation       | 
# | ---------------- | ---------------- | 
# | *≈°akƒÅnum*         | to place (something, someone) | 
# | *mahƒÅ·π£um*         | to strike (something, someone) | 
# | *≈°arƒÅqum*         | to steal (something, someone) | 
# 
# ### Active-Intransitive Verbs
# Verbs of motion.
#   
# | G-stem Infinitive | Translation       | 
# | ---------------- | ----------------: | 
# | *nahƒÅsum*         | to recede | 
# | *wa≈°ƒÅbum*         | to sit down, to dwell | 
# | *maqƒÅtum*         | to fall | 
# 
# ### Adjectival Verbs: 
# Verbs that describes a state.
#   
# | G-stem Infinitive | Translation       |

# | *marƒÅ·π£um*         | to be or to become sick |

# 
# ```{note}
# Some verbs can be in two categories, for example: 
#       
# | G-stem Infinitve  | Translation     | Example | Translation |
# | ---------------- | --------------- | ----- | ----------- |
# | *ka≈°ƒÅdum* act.-tr. | to reach  | *ƒÅlam ak≈°ud* | I reached the city | 
# | *ka≈°ƒÅdum* act.-intr. | to arrive | *m≈´≈°u ika≈°≈°ad* | The night falls |
#     
# The Stem can also change the category:
# 
# | G-stem Infinitve  | Translation            | D-stem Infinitve | Translation |
# | :---------------- | ---------------      | ---------------- | ----------- |
# | *damƒÅqu* adj. verb | to be/to become good  | *dummuqum*     | to imporove something, embellish, beautify" |
