# # G-Stamm
# The G-Stamm is the base stem.  It has no formative element.
# 
# ```{admonition} Good-to-know
# The letter **G** comes from the German "**G**rundstamm", which means "base stem"
# ```
# 
# ## Non-finite forms
# 
# - **Infinitive**. The pattern is *parāsu*. This is the citation form of a verb. That means that all other stems are subsumed after the G-stem
#   ```{admonition} Detail of the Dictionary in GaO 
#   In this picture you can see that the other stems are within the entry *labāšu*, which is in the G-Stem.
