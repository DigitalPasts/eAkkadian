# # L2.5: The G Durative
# The durative denotes an action that takes place over a period of time or an action that has not taken place. It can thus be translated according to the context as simple future, present tense, durative/circumstancial, habitual and modal. In other textbooks the durative is called **Present** or **Present-Furture** 
# 
# ```{important}
# Pattern: Prefix + R₁aR₂R₂vR₃ (+ suffix)
# ```
# 
# ## Personal Affixes
# The personal affixes for the durative are the same as the those of the G preterite. 😌

# ## Theme Vowel
# The theme vowel in the durative pattern R₁aR₂R₂vR₃ is a short one. They are the same as in the G preterite, with the only difference that in the theme vowel **u** of the preterite the durative can have an **a** or **u**. It is thus called **vowel class**.
# 
# ## Vowel Classes
# There are four vowel classes:
# 
# ### a/u-Class
# This group of verbs have the theme vowel ***-u*** in preterite and ***-a*** in durative:
# 
# | Infinitive      | Translation   | Preterite        | Durative       |
# | --------------- | ------------- | -------------    | -------------  |
# | *batāqu*        | to cut off, divide | *ibtuq*     | *ibattaq*      |
