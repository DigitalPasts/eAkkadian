    "This is an introduction to verbal system. The intention is to offer an overview of all possible forms and derivations of the verb. \n",

    "## Non-Finite forms\n",
    "Non-finite forms are nominal forms and as such declinable. There are three of them:\n",

    "- Participle\n",
    "- Verbal Adjective\n",

    "## Finite Forms\n",
    "This forms are inflected by person, gender, number, [indicative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammatical_mood) tenses and [injunctive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammatical_mood) forms:\n",

    "## Stative\n",
    "It is still a matter of dicussion if the stativ is a nominal or a finite form. Nevertheless there is agreement that it arose from a nominal sentence. It describes a state in constrast to the tenses that describe processes, actions, results, etc.\n",

    "## Stems\n",
    "All verbs can be derived according to stems. This is a modification of the root by length of the second radical, prefixes, infixes, etc, which can also be combined with each other. Each of these stems are conventionally referred by letters that represent them:\n",
