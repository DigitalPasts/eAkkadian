# # L2.3: G-Stamm
# The G-Stamm is the base stem.  It has no formative element.
# 
# ```{admonition} Good-to-know
# The letter **G** comes from the German "**G**rundstamm", which means "base stem"
# ```
# 
# ## Non-finite forms
# Non-finite forms are nominal forms and declinable. There are three of them: Infinitive, Participle and Verbal Adjective
# 
# (G_infin)=
# ### Infinitive
# The infinitive is morphologically a noun and is inflected as such. 
# 
# ```{admonition} Nominal Form
# :class: tip
# ***parās***
# ``` 
# 
# This is also the citation form of a verb not only today but already in antiquity. That means that all other stems are subsumed after the G-stem
# 
# ```{admonition} Entry in a Dictionary 
# In this picture you can see that the other stems are within the entry *labāšu*, which is in the G-Stem.
# 
# ![Detail of the dictionary in GaO with the entry *labāšu*](../images/GaO_Dictionary_labacum_stems.png)
# ```
# | Infinitive      | Translation |
# | --------------- | -----------  |
# | *mahāṣum*       | to strike     |
# | *damāqum*       | to be/to become good |
# | *ṣabātum*       | to seize, arrest, capture |  
# 
# (G_part)=
# ### Participle
# It is similar to an adjective and as such it has masculine and feminine forms with singular and plural and cases. 
# 
# ```{admonition} Nominal Form
# :class: tip
# ***pāris*** (masc.), ***pārist*** (fem.) 
# ``` 
# 
# It always has an active meaning:
#   
# | Number | Case      | Masculine | Feminine   |
# |:------ | :----     | --------- | ---------  |
# | sg.    | nom.      | *pārisum* | *pāristum* |   
# |        | gen.      | *pārisim* | *pāristum* |         
# |        | acc.      | *pārisam* | *pāristum* |
# | pl.    | nom.      | *pārisūtum* | *pārisātum* |
# |        | gen./acc. | *pārisūtim* | *pārisātim* |
#  
# ```{warning}
# Verbs that describe a state like *marāṣu* "to be/become sick" **can not have** a participle. 
# ```
# 
# The particple can be translated with a **relative sentence**, an **agent noun** or a **noun of occupation**. 
# 
# | Infinitive      | Translation   | Particple     | Relative clause   | Agent/Occupation noun   |
# | --------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ----------------- | ----------------------  |
# | *paqādum*       | to entrust    | *pāqidum*     | the one who cares | carer, inspector        |
# | *mahāṣum*       | to beat, strike | *māhiṣum*   | the one who beats | beater                  |
# | *zanānu*        | to provision, provide (for, with) | *zāninu* | the one who provides | the provider |   
# 
# It can also accommpany a noun. In that case it is translated into English with the ending **"-ing"**, also known as the gerund.
# 
# | Infinitive      | Translation   | Noun + Particple | Translation |
# | --------------- | ------------- | ---------------- | ---------------- |
# | *mahāṣum*       | to beat, strike | *kakkum māhiṣum* | the smiting weapon |
# | *ṣabātu*        | to seize, take, hold | *šadânum* (a stone) *ṣābitum* | the "holding" stone = magnetite |
#      
# ````{admonition} Good-to-Know 🤔
# When you are not sure how to translate the particple, you can always translate it as a relative clause. Once you have translated the rest of the sentence, you can decide to translate it either as noun, relative sentence or adjectives einding "-ing".
# ````   
# 
# (G_verb-adj)=
# ### Verbal Adjective
# The verbal adjective describes **attributes** or **states**:
# 
# ```{admonition} Nominal Form
# :class: tip 
# - ***paras*** (masc.), ***parast*** (fem.);  
# - ***paris*** (masc.), ***parist*** (fem.); 
# - ***parus*** (masc.), ***parust*** (fem.). 
# 
# The masculines forms with ending ***parsum***.
# ```
#  
# | Infinitive      | Translation   | Verbal Adjective | Translation    |
# | --------------- | ------------- | -------------    | -------------  |
# | *damāqum*       | to be/become good | *damqum*     | good           |
# | *danānum*       | to be/become strong | *dannum*   | strong         |
# 
# Active-transitive Verbs will always have a passive meaning:
# 
# | Infinitive      | Translation   | Verbal Adjective | Translation    |
# | --------------- | ------------- | -------------    | -------------  |
# | *mahāṣum*       | to beat, strike | *mahṣum*       | beaten         |
# | *šarāqum*       | to steal      | *šarqum*         | stolen         |   
# 
# (vowel-sync)=
# ```{warning}
# Note that the short vowel ***i*** between **R₂** and **R₃** are not present. That is because short unstressed vowels between two consonants are often elided (👉*parsum*), unless a long vowel stands before the preceding consonant (👉 *pārisum*). This is also known as **vowel syncope**: 
# 
# - *parsum* (<\**par**i**sum*) = Verbal adjective.
# - *pār**i**sum* (remains unchanged) = Particple. 
# 
# If the short vowel in question precedes an ***r***, it will be sometimes be protected and wont be elide:
# - *šikarum* = "beer".
# - *laberum* = "old". 
# - *zakirum* and *zikrum* = "man" both are attested.
# ```
