    "It is still a matter of discussion if the stative is a verbal or a nominal form. It seems to have developped from a nominal sentence but at the same time it possesses personal endings and can have objects like a verb. Thus in this coursebook it will be treated as a category on its own between verbs and nouns. \n",
