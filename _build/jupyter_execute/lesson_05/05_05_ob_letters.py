# # L5.5: Old Babylonian Letters
# Letters in general have several standarized formulae. An Old Babylonian letter begins with the addressee:
# 
# ```{admonition} Addressee Example
# *ana* PN₁ *qibīma* "Speak to PN₁ (Addressee)"
# ```
# In this formula *qibi* is the Imperative of *qabû*.
# 
# ```{note}
# Normally it is written
# 
# <font size="11">𒆠𒉈𒈠</font> = *qi₂-bi₂-ma*
# ```
# 
# It follows the specification of the sender
# 
# ```{admonition} Sender Example
# *umma* PN-*ma* "thus (says) PN₂ (Sender)"
# ```
# 
# *Umma* is an adverb meaning "thus". 
#

# - *ana šulmīka ašpuram* "I wrote to you on account of your well-being"
