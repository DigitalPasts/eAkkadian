# # Phonems in Akkadian
# Akkadian is a reconstructed language as such it is imposible to determine exactly how the phonems were pronounced. Thus pronunciation is a scholars' convention based on other semitic languages.
# 
# ## Vowels
# There are four vowels. Each one of them can be short or long:
# 
# | Short Vowels| Long Vowels |
# | -------- | -------- |
# | a        | ā/â |
# | e        | ē/ê |
# | i        | ī/î |
# | u        | ū/û |
# 
# The differencen between ā and â is the origin. While the long vowels with *macron* ā have many orignis, the long vowels with the cimcumplex â originate from the contraction of two vowels.
# 
# > it is possible that the vowel "o" existed but in the script it was the same as "u".
