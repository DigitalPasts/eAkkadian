# 
# Akkadian is the oldest known Semitic language, and after Sumerian it is the second oldest language in the Ancient Near East. It belongs to the East Semitic branch together with Eblaite. By contrast, the West Semitic brach has three main subgroups: Central Semitic, South Arabian and Ehtiopian, in which, for example, modern Arabic, Aramaic and Hebrew are located.

# 
# It is still a matter of debate if Eblaite has to be considered as a language on its own or a dialect of an East Semitic laguage that comprises also Akkadian.
