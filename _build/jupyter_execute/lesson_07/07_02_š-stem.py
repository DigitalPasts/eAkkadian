# # L7.2: Š-Stem
# The Š-stem is the causative counterpart of the G-stem.
# 
# 1. The most common use of the Š-stem is as a causative of active-transitive verbs:
# 
#     ```{admonition} Example
#     - *šumqutum* (G *maqātum* "to fall down") "to cause to fall, to fell"
#     - *šuknušum* (G *kanāšum* "to bow down, submit") "to make submissive, to subjugate"
#     ```
# 
# 2. Active-transitive verbs in Š-stem may have two direct objects:
# 
#    ```{admonition} Example
#    - *awâtki ahhīja ušešmi* "I made my brother hear your words"
#    - *ṣuhāram ṭuppam uštābilakkum* "I have had a servant take (*wabālum*, Š Perfect) the tablet to you"
#    ```
# 
# 3. Some adjectival verbs uses the Š-stem instead of the D-stem for a factitive:
#     ```{admonition} Example
#     - *šumruṣum* "to make sick, cause trouble"
#     ```
# 
# 4. A few verbs only in the Š-stem:
#     ```{admonition} Example
#     - *šutlumum* "to give, lend"
#     - *šuklulum* "to complete"
#     ```
# 
# 5. Sometimes it is not clear to differentiate the meanings of the D and Š-stems:
#     ```{admonition} Example
#     - *kunnušum* and *šuknušum* "to subjugate"
#     - *(w)utturum* "to augment" and *šūturum "to increase, surpass"
#     ```
# 
# ## Morphological Characteristics
# 
# 1. The Š-stem is charachterized by a prefix *š*, which precedes the root consonants in all forms:
# 
#     |               | Š-Stem      | 
#     | -------       | -------------- | 
#     | Durative      | *u**š**apras*   | 
#     | Perfect       | *u**š**tapris*  | 
#     | Preterite     | *u**š**apris*    | 
#     | Imperative    | ***š**upris*   |  
#     | Participle    | *mu**š**aprisum*   |
#     | Verbal Adj.   | ***š**uprusum*  | 
#     | Infinitive    | ***š**uprusum*   | 
#     | Stative       | ***š**uprus*  | 
# 
#    ```{note}
#    - *R₂* follos *R₁* immediately in all forms 
#    - Between the *š* and *R₁* there will always be a vowel, either *u* or *a*.
#    - The *t* of the perfect follows *š* immediately.
#    ```
# 
# 2. The D and Š-stems have similar vowel configuration:
# 
#     |               | Š-Stem            | D-Stem        |      
#     | -------       | --------------    | ------------  |
#     | Durative      | ***u***š***a***R₁R₂***a***R₃    | ***u***R₁***a***R₂R₂***a***R₃
#     | Durative      | *ušapras*         | *uparras*
# 
#    ```{note}
#    - Like in the D-stem there is no a vowel class in the Š-stem
#    - Like in the D-stem the Durative has the vowel *a* and the Perfect together with the preterite have the vowel *i* in the Š-stem.
#    - Like in the D-stem the prefixes of the durative, perfect and preterite have the prefix *u*
#    - Like in the D-stem the Imperative has *i* between *R₂* and *R₃*
#    - Like in the D-stem the Infinitive, verbal adjective and thus the stative have the vowel *u*
# 
# ## I-*n* Verbs
# Since R₁ always comes immediately before R₂ the *n* is assimilated in all forms.
# 
# |               | Š-Stem      | 
# | -------       | -------------- | 
# | Durative      | *ušaddan*   | 
# | Perfect       | *uštaddin*  | 
# | Preterite     | *ušaddin*    | 
# | Imperative    | *šuddin*   |  
# | Participle    | *mušaddinum*   |
# | Verbal Adj.   | *šuddunum*  | 
# | Infinitive    | *šuddunum*   | 
# | Stative       | *šuddun*  |
# 
# ## I-*ʾ*
# The loss of the R₁ has, as expected, caused the legthenin of the preceding vowel in all form with the exeption of the durative, as it is in the Durative of the G-stem. In verbs I-*e*, the usual change of *a*-vowels to *e* takes place:
# 
# |               | *ahāzum*    | *epēšum*    | 
# | -------       | ----------- | ---------   |
# | Durative      | *ušahhaz*   | *ušeppeš*
# | Perfect       | *uštāhiz*   | *uštēpiš*
# | Preterite     | *ušāhiz*    | *ušēpiš*
# | Imperative    | *šūhiz*     | *šūpiš*   
# | Participle    | *mušāhizum* | *mušēpišum*
# | Verbal Adj.   | *šūhuzum*   | *šūpušum*
# | Infinitive    | *šūhuzum*   | *šūpušum*
# | Stative       | *šūhuz*     | *šūpuš*
# 
# ## I-*w*
# These verbs are conjugated like verbs I-*ʾ* in the Š. Some of them change *a* > *e* and a small group of verbs have both conjugations *a* and *e*
# 
# |               | *wabālum*   | *wašābum*   | *šūṣûm*   |
# | -------       | ----------- | ---------   | --------- |
# | Durative      | *ušabbal*   | *ušeššeb*   | *ušeṣṣe*/*ušaṣṣa*
# | Perfect       | *uštābil*   | *uštēšeb*   | *uštēṣi*/*ušaṣṣa*
# | Preterite     | *ušābil*    | *ušēšib*    | *ušēṣi*/*ušaṣṣa*
# | Imperative    | *šūbil*     | *šūšib*     | *šūṣi*
# | Participle    | *mušābilum* | *mušēšibum* | *mušēṣûm*/*mušāṣûm*
# | Verbal Adj.   | *šūbulum*   | *šūšubum*   | *šuṣûm*
# | Infinitive    | *šūbulum*   | *šūšubum*   | *šūṣûm*
# | Stative       | *šūbul*     | *šūšub*     | *šūṣu*
# 
# ## II-weak
# These verbs follow the same rules as for the D-stem:
# 
# ### II-*w* and II-*y*
# 
# |               | *mâtum*  | 
# | -------       | ---------- | 
# | Durative      | *ušmāt*, *ušmattū* | 
# | Perfect       | *uštamīt*, *uštamittū* | 
# | Preterite     | *ušmīt*, *ušmittū* | 
# | Imperative    | *šumīt*, *šumittā* | 
# | Participle    | *mušmittum* |
# | Infinitive    | *šumuttum* |  
# | Verbal Adj.   | *šumuttum* |
# | Stative       | *šumūt*, *šumuttu* | 
# 
# ### II-*ʾ*
# Verbs II-*ʾ* in D-stem are poorly attested. The verbs II₁-₂ (II-*a*) tend to be conjugated with the middle as a strong consonant, although contraction may take place.
# 
# |               | *nêšeum* 
# | -------       | ------------ |
# | Durative      | *ušnēš*/*ušneššū*  |
# | Perfect       | ?                  | 
# | Preterite     | *ušnīš*, *ušneššū* | 
# | Imperative    | ?                  | 
# | Participle    | *muniššum*         |
# | Infinitive    | *šunnušum*  
# | Verbal Adj.   | ?                  |
# | Stative       | ?                  | 
# 
# ## III-Weak
# All vowel-classes are conjugated alike as in the D-stem. In verbs III-e, the *a* becomes *e* (though not always). The usual contraction rules apply:
# 
# |               | Š-Stem      | 
# | -------       | ----------- | 
# | Durative      | *ušabna*    | 
# | Perfect       | *uštabni*   | 
# | Preterite     | *ušabni*    | 
# | Imperative    | *šubni*     |   
# | Participle    | *mušabnûm*  |
# | Verbal Adj.   | *šubnûm*    | 
# | Infinitive    | *šubnûm*    |
# | Stative       | *šubnu*     |
