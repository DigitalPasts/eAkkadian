# # Lesson 1 - Introduction
# We will follow the classical classification according to [part of speech](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Part_of_speech) (word classes). In Akkadian we classify the following word classes:
# 
# - Pronouns
# - Nouns
# - Adjectives
# - Numerals 
# - Verbs 
# - Adverbs 
# - Prepositions
# - Conjunction
# - Subjunctions
# - Negation
# - Partikeln 
# - Interjektionen
# 
# Note that in Akkadian there is no definit article. The definitness is determined according to the context.
# 
# In the first lesson we will explain the nouns and adjectives: Status, Gender, Case, Number
