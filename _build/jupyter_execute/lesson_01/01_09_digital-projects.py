# # L3.8: Terminative-Adverbiative *-iš*
# The ending *-iš* had originally a terminative, later locative, function. It corresponds semantically to the preposition *ana* plus genitive. It can occur on nouns and adjectives:
# 
# ```{admonition} Example
# - *qerbiš* "in the midst".
# ``` 
# 
# - On nouns it is no loonger productive. Its use is very restricted.
# - On infinitve, it denotes purpose:
#   ```{admonition} Example
#   - *amariš* "(in order) to see".
#   ``` 
# - When it is used with another noun, the second is in genitive:
#   ```{admonition} Example
#   - *dāriš ūmī* "forever" (lit. "for perpetuity of days").
#   ```  
# - It can also be used with suffixes.
#   ```{admonition} Example
#   - *šēpiššu* "at his foot".
#   - *qātiššu* "at his foot".
#   ``` 
# - In later stages of the language it can be used with the meaning "like" equivalent to *kīma* + gen. "like a":
#   ```{admonition} Example
#   - *abūbiš* "like a flood" = *kīma abūbim*.
#   - *abūbāniš* "like a flood" (with the suffix *-an*)
#   ```
# 
# - It can be used to form adverbs when it is added to an adjective:
#   ```{admonition} Example
#   - *mādiš* "much greatly".
#   - *damqiš* "well".
#   - *rabîš* "greatly
#   - *hadîš* joyfully
#   ``` 
# - The ending *-išam* is an adverbial suffix that has principally a distributive meaning:
#   ```{admonition} Example
#   - *umišam* "daily".
#   - *warhišam* "monthly".
#   ```
