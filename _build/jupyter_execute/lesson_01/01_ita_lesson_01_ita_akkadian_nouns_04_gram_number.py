# 
# - **Singular**: It has no special ending.
# - **dual**: It is marked by the ending *-ān* in nominative (*īn* in acc.-gen.). Already in Old Babylonian the dual is not being used anymore. Its use is restricted to parts of the body that are pairs, numbers and some other nouns. Adjectives have no dual forms. For more details see ABG §144 and AG 2.1 (f).
# - **plural**: For the masculine it is marked by the endings: *-ū* (nominative) and *-ī* in acc.-gen.; for the feminine nouns and adjectives *-āt*. The masculine adjective is marked by *-ūt*
