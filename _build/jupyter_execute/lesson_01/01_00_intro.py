# # L1.1: Word Class (Parts of Speech) 
# We will follow the classical classification according to [part of speech](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Part_of_speech) (word classes) as modern scholars in Assyriology follow this classification as well. In Akkadian we classify the following word classes:
# 
# - **Nouns** 
# - **Adjectives**
# - **Pronouns** 
# - **Verbs** 
# - **Adverbs** 
# - **Numerals**
# - **Prepositions**
# - **Conjunction**
# - **Subjunctions**
# - **Negation**
# - **Particles**
# - **Interjections**
# 
# ```{note} 
# In Akkadian there is no definite article. The definiteness is determined according to the context.
# ``` 
# ## Nouns - Adjectives - Pronouns
# In this chapter we will study the nouns, adjectives and pronouns. They all share the characteristic of being inflected.
