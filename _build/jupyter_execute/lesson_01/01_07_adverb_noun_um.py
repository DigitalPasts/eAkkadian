# # L3.7: The Locative-Adverbiative *-um*
# The adverbial *-um* as the adverbial *-iš* represents an old case form, which in Old Akkadian or Old Assyrian was still in use but in the Old Babylonian it is not productive anymore.
# 
# - The ending *-um* has a locative function, thus it corresponds to the genitive preceded by the preposition *ana* or *ina*.
# - It can be used independently without a preposition:
#   ```{admonition} Example
#   *ištēn manaʾum* "in/for one mina".
#   ``` 
# - Or with the preposition *ina* or *ana*
#   ```{admonition} Example
#   *ina bītum* "In the house".
#   ``` 
# - When it is used with another noun, the second is in genitive:
#   ```{admonition} Example
#   - *qerbum Babili* "In the middle of Babylon".
#   - *ina libbu mātim* "inside the land". In this case *libbu* without the final *-m*.
#   ``` 
# - It can also be used with suffixes. In this case the *-m* assimilates before the suffix.
# - When it is used with another noun the second is in genitive:
#   ```{admonition} Example
#   - *šaptukki* "on your lip" (= *ina šaptīki*).
#   - *qerbuššu* "in its midst" (= *ina qerbīšu*).
#   - *šepūʾa "at my foot".
# 
# - Sometimes it is preceded by the morpheme *-ān*:
#   ```{admonition} Example
#   - *šaplānum* "underneath" (from *šaplum* "underside").
#   - *elēnum* "above, beyond" (from *ēlûm* "uper").
#   ``` 
# - The use of the locative-adverbial ending is restricted to a few frozen adverbial forms, such as *libbum*.
