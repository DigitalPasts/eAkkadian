# ## Grammatical case
# In Akkadian there are three cases: 
# 
# - The **nominative** has the ending *-um* and indicates the subject in verbal and nominal sentences. For more details see: ABG §153.
# - The **genitive** has the ending *-im* and indicates possession, accompanies the *status constructus* and after prespositions. For more details see: ABG §154.
# - The **accusative:** has the ending *-am* and indicates the direct object of the verbs. It is also used in several adverbial expressions. For more details see: ABG §155.

# 
# Besides there are two more cases that already in Old Babylonian are not productive anymore: 
# 
# - The **locative-adverbialis** has the ending *-um*. It is replaced by the preposition *ina* + genitiv. It is used mainly in frozen adverial phrases.
# - The **terminative-adverbialis**

# They can also be used with pronominal suffixes:
# 
# |  casus    | Masculine | Femenine |
# | --------- | --------  | ------- |
# | loc.-adv. | qatum  | šarratum |  
# | ter.-adv. | 
# 
# They are used in fixed phrases.
