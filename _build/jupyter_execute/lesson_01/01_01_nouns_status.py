# # Lesson 1: Status
# In Akkadian there are three status:
# 
# **Status rectus** is the inflected (nominative, genitive, accusative) form of the noun without genitive. 
# 
# | *Status rectus* | Translation |
# |---------------- | ----------- |
# | *šarrum* (nom.) | king        |
# | *ilam* (acc.)   | god         |
# | *ālim*  (gen.)  | city        |
# | *bēlum* (nom.)  | lord        |
# 
# The endings in the *status rectus* contains the elemen *-m* and is called [*mimmation*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mimation) (there is also an ending with *-n* called [*nunnation*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nunation)). It begins to desappear already in the old Babylonian period, later on completely. For more details see

# **Status constructus** is the form of a noun before another one in genitiv and before a possessive suffix. This is found in all semitic languages. For more details see
