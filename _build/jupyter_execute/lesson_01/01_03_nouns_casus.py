# # Lesson 1: Grammatical case
# In Akkadian there are three grammatical cases: 
# 
# - The **nominative** has the ending *-um* and indicates the subject in verbal and nominal sentences. For more details see: ABG §153.
# - The **genitive** has the ending *-im* and indicates possession, it is used after a prepostition and accompanies the *status constructus*. For more details see: ABG §154.
# - The **accusative:** has the ending *-am* and indicates the direct object of the verbs. It is also used in several adverbial expressions. For more details see: ABG §155.

# | Number | Gender | Case | Substantive | Adjective | translation |
# |------- | ------ | -----| ----------- | --------- | ----------- |
# | sg.    |  masc. | nom. | šarrum      | dannum    | mighty king |
# |        |        | gen. | šarrim      | dannim    | of the mighty king |
# |        |        | acc. | šarram      | dannam    | mighty king |
# ||||||
# | sg.    |  fem   | nom. | šarratum    | dannatum | mighty queen |
# |        |        | gen. | šarratim    | dannatim | of the mighty queen |
# |        |        | acc. | šarratam    | dannatam | mighty queen |
# 
# All other cases are expressed with prepositions. Besides there are two more cases that already in Old Babylonian are not productive anymore: 
# 
# - The **locative-adverbialis** has the ending *-um*. It is replaced by the preposition *ina* + genitiv. It is used mainly in frozen adverial phrases. It can be used with pronominal suffixes. 
# - The **terminative-adverbialis** has the ending *-iš*. It is replaced by the preposition *ana* + genitive.
# 
# |  Case     | Noun    | Femenine |
# | --------- | ------- | ------- |
# | loc.-adv. | *qat-um*  | into the hand |  
# | loc.-adv. | *rittūšša* (\<*ritt-um-ša*) | into her hand |
# | ter.-adv. | *ašar-iš* | to the place |
# 
# ## Vowel Contractions 
# When two vowels appear consecutively, they are usually contracted. Generally the second one dominates. This contraction length is shown by circumflex:
# 
# | First vowel + second vowel | contracted long vowel |
# | -------------------------- | --------------------- |
# | *a* + *a*                  | *â*                   |
# | *a* + *i*                  | *ê*                   |
# | *a* + *u*                  | *û*                   |
# |||
# | *i* + *a*                  | *ia* (*â*)            |
# | *i* + *i*                  | *î*                   |
# | *i* + *u*                  | *û*                   |
# |||
# | *u* + *a*                  | *â*                   |
# | *u* + *i*                  | *î*                   |
# | *u* + *u*                  | *û*                   |
