# # L1.3: Grammatical Case
# In Akkadian there are three grammatical cases: 
# 
# - The **nominative** has the ending *-um* and indicates the subject in verbal and nominal sentences. For more details see: ABG §153.
# - The **genitive** has the ending *-im* and indicates possession, it is used after a prepostition and accompanies the *status constructus*. For more details see: ABG §154.
# - The **accusative:** has the ending *-am* and indicates the direct object of the verbs. It is also used in several adverbial expressions. For more details see: ABG §155.

# |        |        | acc. | *šarratam dannatam* | mighty queen |
# 
# All other cases are expressed with prepositions. Besides there are two more cases that already in Old Babylonian are not productive anymore: 
# 
# - The **locative** has the ending *-um*. It is replaced by the preposition *ina* + genitiv. It is used mainly in frozen adverial phrases. It can be used with pronominal suffixes. 
# - The **terminative** has the ending *-iš*. It is replaced by the preposition *ana* + genitive.
