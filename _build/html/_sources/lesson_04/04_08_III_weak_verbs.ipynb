    "# L4.8: III-Weak Verbs\n",
    "There are two groups of III-weaks verbs:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Roots that consist of two consonants and have a long vowel *ī* or *ū*\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```{admonition} Example\n",
    "    *banûm* \"to build\" with *ī*\n",
    "    *manûm* \"to count\" with *ū*\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "2. Verbs III-*ʾ that can also be divided into two subgroups:\n",
    "   - Verbs III-*ʾ* of *ʾ*₁: **without** coloring *a* > *e*.\n",
    "   - Verbs III-*ʾ* of *ʾ*₃, *ʾ*₄, *ʾ*₅: **with** coloring *a* > *e*.\n",
    "\n",
    "In all Verbs III-weak the originally long vowel shortens in final position:\n",
    "\n",
    "```{admonition} Example\n",
    "- With *ī*: *ibni* < \\**ibnī* \"he built\"\n",
    "- With *ū*: *imnu* < \\**imnū* \"hecounted\"\n",
    "- With *ā*: *ikla* < \\**iklā* \"he restrained\"\n",
    "- With *ē*: *ešme* < \\**ešmē* \"he heard\" \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The transfer from one group to the other is frequent:\n",
    "\n",
    "```{admonition} Example\n",
    "- *imnu* and *imni* \"he counted\"\n",
    "```\n"
