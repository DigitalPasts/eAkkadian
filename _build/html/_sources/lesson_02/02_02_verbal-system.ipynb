    "## Finite Forms\n",
    "This forms are inflected by person, gender, number, [indicative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammatical_mood) tenses and [injunctive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammatical_mood) forms:\n",

    "## Stems\n",
    "All verbs can be derived according to stems. This is a modification of the root by length of the second radical, prefixes, infixes, etc, which can also be combined with each other. Each of these stems are conventionally referred by letters that represent them:\n",
